### Identity
A digital identity is a collection of unique identifiers or attributes that represent a human, software component, machine, asset, or resource in a computer system. An identifier can be:

``An email address
Sign-in credentials (username/password)
Bank account number
Government issued ID
MAC address or IP address
``

``
Identities are used to authenticate and authorize access to resources, communicate with other humans, conduct transactions, and other purposes.
``

### Authentication
``Authentication is the process of challenging a person, software component, or hardware device for credentials in order to verify their identity, or prove they're who``

``Authentication typically requires the use of credentials`` (like username and password, fingerprints, certificates, or one-time passcodes). Authentication is sometimes shortened to AuthN.

``Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security measure that requires users to provide more than one piece of evidence to verify their identities, such as:``

``Something they know, for example a password.``

``Something they have, like a badge or security token.``

``Something they are, like a biometric (fingerprint or face).``


### Authorization
Authorization validates that the user, machine, or software component has been granted access to certain resources. Authorization is sometimes shortened to AuthZ.

### Authentication vs. authorization

``Authentication proves the identity of a user, machine, or software component.``

``Authorization grants or denies the user, machine, or software component access to certain resources.``
