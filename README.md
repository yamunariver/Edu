### Authentication
Authentication is the process of challenging a person, software component, or hardware device for credentials in order to verify their identity, or prove they're who or what they claim to be. ``Authentication typically requires the use of credentials`` (like username and password, fingerprints, certificates, or one-time passcodes). Authentication is sometimes shortened to AuthN.
